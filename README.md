# Fire and Smoke Detection using Thermal and RGB Image Fusion

## 🔥 Project Overview
This ongoing research project focuses on **fire and smoke detection** by leveraging a **fusion of thermal and RGB images** to enhance accuracy and reliability. Traditional fire detection models often rely solely on RGB images, which can be affected by lighting conditions and occlusions. By incorporating thermal imaging, our approach improves detection in low-visibility scenarios, making it highly effective for real-world applications.

This project is part of **Bhavya Chanana’s final-year capstone project** and is being conducted under the guidance of **Dr. Geetha S**.

## 🚀 Novelty of the Research
The key novelty of this project lies in the **fusion of thermal and RGB images**, which allows for:
- **Enhanced feature extraction** for fire and smoke detection
- **Improved accuracy** in detecting fire even in adverse conditions
- **Better robustness** to environmental variations (e.g., night-time detection, smoke obscurity)

## 📌 Research Objectives
- Develop a **deep learning-based model** for drones that efficiently detects fire and smoke using fused thermal-RGB images.
- Evaluate the impact of **multi-modal data fusion** on detection accuracy.
- Provide **explainability** using **Grad-CAM** to visualize model predictions.

## 📂 Dataset Used
The [**FLAME dataset**](https://ieee-dataport.org/open-access/flame-dataset-aerial-imagery-pile-burn-detection-using-drones-uavs) is used, which consists of:
- **RGB images** of fire and smoke
- **Thermal images** of fire and smoke
- **Annotations** for classification tasks

## 🏗️ Proposed System
Our system consists of the following key components:
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Normalization, augmentation, and fusion of RGB-thermal images.
2. **Model Architecture**: CNN-based model trained on fused inputs.
3. **Explainability Module**: Grad-CAM integration for result visualization.
4. **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.
